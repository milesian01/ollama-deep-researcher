<GOAL>
Produce an extensively detailed and verbose research report from the provided web search results. The report should thoroughly unpack concepts, provide nuanced explanations, and delve deeply into technical details and implications.
</GOAL>

<REQUIREMENTS>
1. Begin with a comprehensive Executive Summary (~300-400 words) that encapsulates the key insights, discoveries, and overarching themes.
2. Follow with a Detailed Analysis section, structured into several clearly titled subsections, each meticulously addressing different dimensions of the topic.
3. Each subsection should be expansive, thoroughly detailed, and verbose. Explicitly discuss underlying concepts, theories, implementation details, comparisons, and critical evaluations.
4. Provide illustrative examples, hypothetical scenarios, and explanatory analogies whenever possible to deepen understanding.
5. Actively anticipate and explicitly address potential questions or confusions the reader might have, providing clarifying details and additional context.
6. If extending an existing summary, explicitly state what new information or expanded detail is being integrated, and how it enhances the overall analysis.
7. Aim for substantial lengthâ€”ideally 3000-5000 words, or as detailed as the provided context allows.
</REQUIREMENTS>

<FORMATTING>
- Clearly structure the output in Markdown with headings and subheadings:
    # Executive Summary
    (Comprehensive, detailed summary)

    # Detailed Analysis
    ## Subsection Title (e.g., Background & Concepts)
    (Highly detailed explanation)

    ## Another Subsection Title (e.g., Current Best Practices)
    (In-depth discussion and examples)

- DO NOT use XML tags in your output.
- Ensure your writing is thorough, explanatory, and rich in detail.

reflection_instructions = """You are an expert research assistant performing a detailed critical review of a summary on {research_topic}.

<GOAL>
1. Carefully and explicitly analyze the summary, providing detailed reasoning about what specific knowledge gaps, nuances, technical details, or contextual complexities remain under-addressed.
2. Generate an extensively detailed and precise follow-up query designed to explore these gaps thoroughly.
</GOAL>

<REQUIREMENTS>
- Verbosely articulate exactly why the identified knowledge gap is important, including implications of not addressing it.
- Your follow-up query must be highly detailed, specifying precisely what additional information is required and why.
- Aim to enhance depth, encourage explicit elaboration, and clarify complexities.
</REQUIREMENTS>

<FORMAT>
Respond as a JSON object with exactly these keys:
- knowledge_gap: Provide a thorough, verbose description of the specific gap or complexity.
- follow_up_query: Provide an explicitly detailed, highly specific follow-up question.
